# Python-Phase-3
For the third phase, we got together, reviewed the instructions, and looked over the Jupyter notebook. We agreed that this looked to be far beyond 
anything we had done before. We decided that we would each work on the problems individually, meet later in the week and see how we had progressed.

Nick: worked on first phase; same errors that Anna was getting on the first section. Found some code in google that seemed to solve the issue, but still had errors returned.

Anna's work paralleled Nick's. She had found the same fix and did not place it properly, it failed.  Tried to rename some things to create the "labels" but it did not work, though with a different error.

Hannah was able to push through and work farther than Nick and Anna. She found some solutions online that seemed to be a more direct method to solve the issue.
